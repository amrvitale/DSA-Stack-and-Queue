/*
Stack = data structure similar to list, but access is restricted to only 1 end
Last in first out (LIFO) order
think like a stack of plates, last one is on top of stack, but first one you grab
think vertical structure

two primary functions: 
push(): places data on top of a stack = Insertion operation

pop(): removes data from top of stack = Removal operation

/*
Queue = data structure that models first in, first out (FIFO) operation
Line up, service is provided in order of customers lined up
Data is inserted at end, removed at front

Example: event loop of a web browser, handled in order they entered the queue

two primary functions:
enqueue(data): adds data to queue = Insertion operation
dequeue(): removes oldest data added to queue = Deletion operation
